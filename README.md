# Zion

Zion is the church manager system.

#### Reasons why
Churches works like enterprise. Has people, roles, hierarchy, money, departments, organization and etc.
It's really works like an enterprise and, because of it, has the same problems.
When I searched systems like Zion I was found nothing free. 
So, with the community power this system will be the most church system ever.
